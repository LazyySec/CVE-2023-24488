# CVE-2023-24488

POC for CVE-2023-24488

Citrix Gateway Open Redirect and XSS (CVE-2023-24488)
URL query parameters are not adequately sanitised before they are placed into an HTTP Location header. An attacker can exploit this to create a link which, when clicked, redirects the victim to an arbitrary location. Alternatively the attacker can inject newline characters into the Location header, to prematurely end the HTTP headers and inject an XSS payload into the response body.
